		flatmates saved this situation. After being together a lot of time beacuse of lockdown, he made a close relationship with all of his flatmates
		Which leaded to a really comfortable and entretaing every-day life. With many parties and drinking involved.
		Apart from that, he found out about a group who played beach volleyball many times a week, so he decided to join them. 
		He spent the hole year playing with them , didnt matter what weather or daytime it was, he would always go all the way to
