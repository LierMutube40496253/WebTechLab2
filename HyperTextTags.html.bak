		<p>
		We can either use a link to an image from a website on the web, e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.
		com/siwells/set08101/master/resources/vmask.jpg as in the example above, or we can use
		a local image file. If you do use a link to an image that is someone elseâ€™s site then this is often
		considered bad form. You also have no control over what your link actually points to and the
		image could be replaced with something else at any point. The best case scenario is that the image
		link becomes broken.
