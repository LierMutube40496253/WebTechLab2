		<h3>Why <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier</a></h3>
		<p>
		Lier wanted to study computing sience, but the univerties he had near home didnt convince him. Also he was a bit
		bored of living on the same. We wanted to meet new people, change habits and have new experiences.
		At the same time, his unckle told him about
		<a href="https://www.saas.gov.uk/">SAAS </a> 
		and how the universities in Scotland paid the university fees to the european students. Inmideatly he applyed to many univeristes at scotland, but he knew
		his destination was 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh </a> 
		for sure. So once he saw he got accepted at napier univeristy he decided he was going to study 
		to Scotland.
