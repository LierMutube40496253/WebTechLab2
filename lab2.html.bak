		<h3>Why <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier</a></h3>
		<p>
		Lier wanted to study computing sience, but the univerties he had near home didnt convince him. Also he was a bit
		bored of living on the same. We wanted to meet new people, change habits and have new experiences.
		At the same time, his unckle told him about
		<a href="https://www.saas.gov.uk/">SAAS </a> 
		and how the universities in Scotland paid the university fees to the european students. Inmideatly he applyed to many univeristes at scotland, but he knew
		his destination was 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh </a> 
		for sure. So once he saw he got accepted at napier univeristy he decided he was going to study 
		to Scotland.

		<h3>How has it been?</h3>
		<p>
		At the begging of the course COVID made a huge impact on this expierence. They were no activities to do apart from studying.
		Pubs and clubs were closed, streets were empty and it was really cold. But his
		<a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/study-with-us/accommodation/bainfield">Bainfild accomodation </a>
		flatmates saved this situation. After being together a lot of time beacuse of lockdown, he made a close relationship with all of his flatmates
		Which leaded to a really comfortable and entretaing every-day life. With many parties and drinking involved.
		Apart from that, he found out about a group who played beach volleyball many times a week, so he decided to join them. 
		He spent the hole year playing with them , didnt matter what weather or daytime it was, he would always go all the way to
		<a href="https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/portobello-beach-p2570361">Portobello Beach </a>
		and play for hours. Next year he would join to the Napier University Volleyball Club and become one of their commite member.
